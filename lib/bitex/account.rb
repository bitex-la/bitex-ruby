module Bitex
  # These endpoints give you access general information about your account such as your balances, movements including deposits,
  # withdrawals as well as executed bids and asks, and your list of KYC Profiles, a collection of all the people or legal
  # entities associated to your bitex account in any capacity.
  #
  # If you're looking for your individual trades see Your latest Trades.
  # Most accounts only need one KYC Profile, if you need to create sub-accounts have a look at our Reseller API.
